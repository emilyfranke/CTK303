<p class="lead">
  When students look for "coffee shops" in Normal, IL they frequent 7 main store fronts. Coffee House, Coffee Hound, Fusion Brew, Dunkin Donuts, Starbucks and lastly my kitchen.
  Each coffeeshop has their strong suits but also their weaknesses. Maybe you're looking for an independent brew? A short wait? Low prices? A close walk?
  You'll be able to find your best options while reading through our reviews of each place.

<h2 class="display-6"> Coffee House </h2>
<p>
Coffee House is a stand alone coffee shop that offers many different cheap coffee and tea drinks. It is based in Uptown Normal and
the place itself is very cute. Coffee House draws a large college homework crowd on the weekend because of it's variety of seating and open space indoors.
Their full menu of vegan and vegetarian all-day-breakfast options are even more of a reason to go than their coffee. But, my favorite drink here is the Thai Iced Coffee.
It is cheap, delicious and the perfect for a carriage ride into uptown during the summer.

<div class="col">
<img src="hound.png" alt="coffee hound">
<h2 class="display-6"> Coffee Hound </h2>
<p>
  Coffee Hound has three locations in Bloomington and Normal. My personal favorite location is just a bike ride down Constituion Trail next to Green Top Grocery.
  It is very small, never crowded and they have the best tasting coffee in town. Now, their prices are some of the steepest but I would pay double because the espresso is absoltley perfect.
  If you go to the Coffee Hound location just down the street from Coffee House in Uptown Normal you will most likley find a good sized line to wait in. But, it moves quickly and it the coffee
  is worth the wait. Try their oatmilk vanilla latte and you'll understand why the line is so long.

    <div class="col">
<img src="fusion.jpg" alt="fusion brew">
<h2 class="display-6"> Fusion Brew </h2>
<p>
  Fusion Brew is just on the other side of campus and also brings a good sized homework crowd. They offer a cozy interior and never too long of a wait. The coffee options go from hot lattes to Boba Tea.
  The prices are right around that college budget of Coffee House's and while my favorite drink here is an almondmilk vanilla latte many students praise their boba teas.

    <div class="col">
<img src="dunkin.jpg" alt="dunkin">
<h2 class="display-6"> Dunkin Donuts </h2>
<p>
  America runs on caffiene. So of course there is a Dunkin Donuts near by. But as our first chain coffeeshop review I don't have much to praise other than their drive thru. If the local shops are closed, which is likely
  because they all close around 4pm, or it is too cold to leave the car then Dunkin might be your best option. The lines are usually very long, the coffee is ok and they raised their prices. My roommate Savannah has a giftcard so she will be going
  this week.

<h2 class="display-6"> Starbucks </h2>
<p>
  I'm a starbucks barista. So is my other roommate, Shannon. So I only drink free coffee from Starbucks. Pros: There is literally a location on every corner in any state and something for everyone.
Cons: Expensive. My favorite drinks currently are Oatmilk Green Tea Lattes and Vanilla Oatmilk Coldbrews. Don't get the food.

<h2 class="display-6"> My Kitchen </h2>
<p> My kitchen has absolutley fire coffee. We have two espresso machines, an Oatmilk surplus, a lot of free starbucks beans and time.
  Every morning is a joy when I make a lattes with my roommates and then make another 4 hours later. </p>
