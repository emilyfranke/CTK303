<p> I am now 22 years old. But, my journey started on September 17th 1998. Born into a world on the brink of a new decade,
	my childhood was immediately scored by an Aerosmith classic. Said power-ballad was written for the film "Armageddon" and I encourage you to click below and listen
	now. I promise, you don't wanna miss a thing. </p>
